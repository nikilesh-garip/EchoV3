/// Automatic "sudden motion" detector built on the device accelerometer.
///
/// This is additive evidence layered on top of the manual "Sudden motion
/// (panic)" toggle, following exactly the philosophy the backend already
/// uses for acoustic media-context detection on top of the manual
/// media-playback toggle (see model/audio_classes.py's
/// `MEDIA_CONTEXT_AUDIOSET_INDICES` comment and backend/main.py's
/// `_resolve_media_context`): the automatic signal only ever ADDS evidence,
/// it never overrides an explicit False from the user. [detected] is meant
/// to be OR'd with the manual toggle at the point the combined value is
/// actually sent to the backend -- this service never claims to replace it.
///
/// A "sudden motion" jolt is detected as a spike in the magnitude of the raw
/// accelerometer vector (x, y, z), which sits around 9.8 m/s^2 (gravity)
/// while the phone is at rest or carried normally. [_jerkThreshold] of
/// 20 m/s^2 total magnitude was picked as a sensible midpoint: ordinary
/// handling and walking rarely push the raw magnitude much past 12-15
/// m/s^2, while a fall, a hard drop, or someone breaking into a run
/// reliably spikes well past 20. Once a qualifying jolt is seen, [detected]
/// stays true for [_holdDuration] so a single spike reads as "motion
/// recently", then clears itself automatically -- it must never stay
/// pinned true from one old jolt.
