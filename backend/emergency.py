"""Incident lifecycle and contact escalation.

Why this exists
---------------
Until now Echo only ever showed an alert to the person who was already in the
room -- which is the one person who does not need to be told. This module
turns a verified high-risk detection into an *outbound* escalation to the
people the user nominated: an automated voice call that plays the five
seconds of audio Echo actually heard, and a Telegram message carrying the same
clip, the class, the risk score, and the location.

Safety rules encoded here (not optional, not configurable away)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Cancel window.** An incident is created in ``PENDING`` and only dispatches
   after ``settings.cancel_window_seconds``. The person in the room can cancel
   it from the app in one tap. A model score is evidence, not proof.
2. **Risk floor.** Auto-escalation requires ``risk_score >= settings.min_risk_score``
   and a verified detection. Anything below that is logged, not broadcast.
3. **Cooldown.** One escalation per user per ``settings.cooldown_seconds``.
   A firecracker night must not dial a contact forty times.
4. **No emergency-services auto-dial.** This escalates to the user's *own*
   nominated contacts only. Calling 112/police stays user-initiated, exactly as
   docs/SAFETY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md requires -- a personal contact can judge
   a false alarm and hang up; a dispatched police unit cannot be un-dispatched.
5. **Honest wording.** Every message says "may be in danger" and "what sounded
   like", and demo-profile incidents announce themselves as demonstrations.
6. **Per-channel truth.** Each attempt records sent / simulated / failed with a
   detail string, and the app shows exactly that. No silent failures.

    was armed (created_at), not the moment it finished dispatching.

    Two things this must get right, both found by testing after the fact:

    1. Must exclude class_name='normal': /escalation/test (a rehearsal
       button) creates its incident with class_name="normal" and does
       dispatch for real. Using dispatched_at with no class filter meant
       running a test alert armed a real cooldown window afterward -- a
       genuine emergency arriving within cooldown_seconds of a rehearsal
       would come back "Cooldown active" and never reach the user's
       contacts. No real incident is ever created with class_name="normal"
       (escalation_gate requires an ESCALATION_CLASSES member), so this
       filter can never exclude a real emergency.
    2. Must key off created_at, not dispatched_at, and must count PENDING/
       DISPATCHING incidents, not only ones that finished. Every incident
       sits PENDING for cancel_window_seconds before it dispatches; using
       only completed dispatches meant two verified high-risk detections
       arriving seconds apart (repeat gunfire, a burst of alarm sounds --
       exactly the "firecracker night" scenario this cooldown exists for,
       see the module docstring) could BOTH pass the gate and both go on to
       call/message contacts, because neither had a dispatched_at yet when
       the other checked.

    CANCELLED/SUPPRESSED/NO_CONTACTS incidents don't count: they were never
    delivered, so they shouldn't block a later real escalation from arming.
